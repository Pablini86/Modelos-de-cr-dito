# Modelos-de-cr-dito
This model will be to present our project of credits model´s class

Project Overview

In this consolidated project, you will apply your knowledge of traditional credit modeling and credit risk modeling to create a comprehensive solution. You will:

Develop a Traditional Credit Model

Build the model using Excel or Python.
Analyze and Justify Interest Rate Formation

Focus on the interest rate structure for your chosen credit product and provide a rationale.
Build a Credit Risk Model

Implement the model in Python, including a logic diagram to illustrate the process.
Document Your Process and Findings

Compile a final report detailing the entire workflow, methodology, and results.
By combining these elements, you’ll demonstrate how credit models are designed, tested, and applied in real-world scenarios, along with how interest rates and risk premiums are determined.
